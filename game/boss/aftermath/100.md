- The number 100 is the only code in this game that doesn’t represent failure or success — but **knowledge**.
- Some paths may only be fully understood by exploring the `.bashrc`, `prophecy.txt`, or ancient files in `/game/secrets`.
- The Codex is updated with each **artifact unearthed** or **law rewritten**.

### Knowledge Beyond Victory

- The number `100` is the only code in this game that doesn’t represent failure or success — but **insight**.
- Some truths are buried deep in:
  - `~/.bashrc`
  - `prophecy.txt`
  - `runes.log`
  - 🗝️ And other secrets within `/game/secrets/`
- Only the most curious minds will decipher the full shape of the Forkstorm.

> _"The wisest devs do not seek the quickest route — but the one with the most meaningful exceptions."_ 🧙‍♂️

### 🧩 Fractured Runes

Some runes were scattered across the Repoverse.  
Only those who dig past the surface — or misstep gloriously — may find them.
