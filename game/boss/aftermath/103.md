# 🧠 103 - The Echo of Hints

> _"Before the final seal breaks,  
> some hear whispers… others ignore them.  
> But those who listen, might survive the Callback.”_

The scroll flickers faintly with arcane dev-energy.  
It doesn’t reveal the answer — but it **points**.

> 🧙 **Hint from the Hacker God:**  
> You have seen the five. You have heard their promise.  
> But what if the **right answer** doesn’t seek applause…  
> …but **hides in plain sight**, uninvited to the stage?

Seek beyond the clickable.  
Beyond the glimmer of buttons.  
Beyond what you were told to choose.

🧾 *This scroll will disappear once the Callback awakens.*
