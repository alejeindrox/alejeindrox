# 🧬 201 - The Birth of a New Dev

> _“Some do not end the journey — they reboot it.”_

A spark glows inside your `~/.bash_profile`.  
A new Git identity. A clean `main` branch.  
The stack is quiet.  
The backlog — empty.

You are not the same dev who entered the boss room.

> 🧙 **Hacker God declares:**  
> _“You are no longer a junior.  
> You are a fork of experience,  
> a child of all three paths.”_

You begin again. With **power and memory**.
