# 🌀 203 - The Non-Authoritative Prophecy

> _“Some prophecies are true.  
> Others... just passed cache validation.”_

This scroll contains:

- Half a stack trace from a server you've never used  
- A `TODO` from a mage’s apprentice  
- A Git conflict marker with no origin  
- And a recipe for... pancakes?

You’re not sure if this is documentation or a distraction.

> 🧙 **Hacker God shrugs:**  
> _“Reality is consistent — unless cached.”_

Read at your own risk.
