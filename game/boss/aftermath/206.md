# 🧩 206 - Partial Upload to the Codex

> _“The data stream broke…  
> but some pieces reached the Dev Codex.”_

You uncovered:

- 🗂️ An unmerged changelog fragment  
- 📎 A `.secret` file with an invalid checksum  
- 📜 A reference to an `ancient-artifact.yaml`, marked `[WIP]`

But the transmission was cut.  
The Forkstorm grows unstable again.

> _“What was lost may still be recovered.  
> But not today.”_
