# ♾️ 308 - The Infinite Redirect

> _“There was a route. Then a redirect.  
> Then another. And another…”_

You follow a trail of clues.  
Each scroll points to another.  
Each file references a path that doesn’t hold the truth —  
just another reference.

The Hacker God laughs gently.

> _“Some devs solve problems.  
> Others just follow the breadcrumbs forever.”_
