# ❌ Aftermath: Bad Invocation

You lit the Torch of Debugging.  
You summoned the Knight of Regression.  
You crossed the Gate of No Return with pride.

But you forgot the ritual of binding.

The Artifact was never verified.  
The deploy lacked provenance.  
You relied on logs, instincts… and hope.

The Knight fought bravely, but too late.  
The system rejected the change, silently.  
The Vaults reverted on their own — to what, no one knows.

> “There’s no diff,” the Apprentice of Commits says.  
> “But... everything feels wrong.”

You look back, but the Gate is gone.

Rollback is no longer an option.  
And rollback was your only salvation.
