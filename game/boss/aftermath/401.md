# 🔒 401 - Unauthorized Spell

> _“You utter the incantation…  
> but the repository rejects your voice.”_

The path is sealed.  
Your artifact lacks the sigil of multi-path knowledge.  
No stack overflowed for you.  
No Forkstorm obeyed your merge.

A translucent firewall flares to life —  
bearing the symbol of the **Dev Pact**.

> 🧙 **The Hacker God booms:**  
> _“This spell requires access level: **Polyclassed Debugger.**  
> You have not walked all three paths.  
> Yet.”_
