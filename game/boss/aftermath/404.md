# ❌ Aftermath: File Not Found

The Code Oracle passed your code with glowing runes.  
The Trial of the Wise was swift — no reviewers questioned your path.  
The Eternal Pipeline flowed without delay.

You watched the logs. They were silent. You took silence as peace.

But peace is not success.

No data moved.  
No users reached the new code.  
No system rebooted.  
The deploy worked… somewhere else.

Later, the Archmage of Merge Conflicts appears, eyes hollow:

> “You deployed to staging... from a detached HEAD.”

The Demon of Callback Hell smiles.  
He doesn’t attack your code.  
He lets you believe it worked.
