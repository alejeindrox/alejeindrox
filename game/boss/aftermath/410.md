# 🪞 410 - The Gone Mirror

> Now, it's just… reflection.”_

You arrive at a void.

A portal stands still, like a `git remote` with no upstream.  
The commit history stops.  
The changelog forgets.

> You whisper `git log --follow`,  
> but the file — and its fate — are gone.

Some say the path was deleted.  
Others say it **never existed** in the first place.
