# ❌ Aftermath: I Am Not A Teapot

The battle was not won.  
But you rang the Nexus Bell anyway.  
You declared victory. You completed the Forkstorm Rites.

Confetti rained in the chatroom.  
The Artifact was merged. The pipeline sang.

But production remained untouched.

Your announcement was seen by 37 team members,  
reposted by the Oracle of Features,  
and auto-translated into 6 languages.

No one noticed the absence of impact.

> “Wait… this wasn’t behind a Feature Flag?”  
> The Archmage of Merge Conflicts blinks.

In a distant shard, something crashes.  
A user refreshes. Nothing works.  
The Demon sips your triumph like tea.
