# ❌ Aftermath: Internal Failure

You marked the Artifact with reverence.  
Its version sealed in the Book of Releases.  
The Runic Automatons awoke and obeyed.  
Tests passed. Containers shifted. Green lights pulsed in harmony.

But… something was missing.

Your release notes pointed to features that weren’t in production.  
The changelog was correct. The deploy logs were correct.  
But users… saw nothing new.

The Knight of Regression returns from the frontlines:

> “The code never reached the shard controlling the Vault of Accounts.”

The Demon grins.

He doesn’t block your steps —  
He **lets you skip one**.

And one is all he needs.
