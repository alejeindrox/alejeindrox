# 🌩️ 502 - The Broken Gateway

> _“You reached the edge of a realm…  
> but its guardian never answered.”_

The Gateway flickered.  
You invoked the correct rites.  
But the response?

> A silent buffer. A timeout echo. A handshake forgotten.

The dev realm beyond remains unreachable —  
its API trembling behind proxy shadows,  
its load balancer chasing its own tail.

The Hacker God sighs:

> _"Even the right path fails if the gatekeeper naps."_
