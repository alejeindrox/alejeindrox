# ❌ Aftermath: Service Unavailable

The Infrastructure Sigils glowed bright.  
Auto-scalers danced. CPU stood firm. RAM barely moved.  
You summoned metrics from the Realm and saw… stability.

But stability is not success.

The Artifact was never invoked.  
You watched the container warm up, but never serve.  
No errors. No deploy. Just... uptime.

An Apprentice of Commits later mutters:

> “I think it’s still running the build from Tuesday.”

You look again. The metrics are still green.  
But the users are gone.  
And in the shadows of the dashboard, the Demon watches…

He thrives in graphs that measure **everything** — except what matters.
