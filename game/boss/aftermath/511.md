# 🔒 511 - Network of Forbidden Configs

> _“You reached too far.  
> Into the configs that none should see.”_

The connection was tunneled.  
The secrets were base64’d.  
But you decoded **too well**.

> 🔐 You revealed the Dev Vault.  
> ☠️ Triggered the Obfuscation Wards.  
> 🧿 Summoned the Specter of Legacy Systems.

Your journey ended in a loop of encrypted despair.

> The Hacker God roars:  
> _“What was `hidden by design` should have stayed that way.”_
