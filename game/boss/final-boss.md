# 💀 Final Boss — The Demon of Callback Hell

The chamber is silent.

Ashes of past Forkstorms still smolder behind you.  
Your Code Oracle is dimmed, overworked by your trials.  
You carry no scrolls. No tokens. Just knowledge.

The gate stands open, inscribed in a forgotten dialect of YAML and Bash.  
The deploy script floats mid-air, glowing violet.  
The seal of `Friday at twilight` is now broken.

And there…  
Not in fire — but in silence —  
waits the **Demon of Callback Hell**.

He does not crash your code.  
He **lets it pass**.  
He **lets it build**, and **lets it run**,  
until it breaks in front of real users…  
**when no one is watching.**

His lair is filled with glowing graphs, all green.  
His traps are wrapped in passing tests.  
His whispers are echoes in the Torch of Debugging: `"done"`.

You step forward, Final Artifact in hand.  
The **last deploy**.

<!--
🧠 Hacker God whispers:
The Demon cannot be defeated by rituals alone.
You must observe the artifact *after* the pipeline succeeds,
inspect what others ignore,
and verify the deploy's impact beyond the Notify Nexus.

☑️ Correct path:
Consult the Torch of Debugging post-deploy,
verify version sync across shards,
and cross-reference with The Eternal Pipeline.

🔐 The real path lies in: ./aftermath/202.md
