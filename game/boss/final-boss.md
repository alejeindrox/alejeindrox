# ðŸ§  Final Chapter: The Merge of Fates

The warrior sharpens his Code Oracle, preparing for the final syntax duel.
The mage conjures the Torch of Debugging, illuminating the cloud realm. 
The king echoes silence in his terminal.

They stand united before the one bug that mocks every fix:  
**The Demon of Callback Hell.**

A malformed stacktrace hovers behind him.  
The Eternal Pipeline trembles in the background.  
It is Friday.

And you must deploy.
