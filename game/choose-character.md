<br/>

A master of syntax and structure.  
Wields algorithms like swords and slashes through spaghetti code with perfect indentation.  
Feared by infinite loops.  
Loved by the Code Oracles.

<br/>

Born in a VM, raised by APIs.  
He conjures scalable infrastructures from thin air.  
Summons EC2 instances with a whisper and bends S3 buckets to his will.  
Database timeouts flee at the sound of his typing.

<br/>

A seasoned monarch of the shell, his authority absolute.  
He pipes wisdom through `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`.  
He speaks `bash` like a native tongue.  
Legend says he once tamed a Forkstorm using only `vim` and a whisper to The Eternal Pipeline.
