# ❌ Error: The Curse of final2.sh

You copied the script. Renamed it to `final2.sh`.  
Added your line. Committed.

Now both `final.sh` and `final2.sh` run.  
No one knows when or why.  
The deploy runs twice — but differently.

The Demon of Callback Hell is delighted.  
Your pipeline now forks itself.
