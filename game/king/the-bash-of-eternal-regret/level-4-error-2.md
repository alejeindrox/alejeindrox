# ‚ùå Error: The One-Time Execution Lie

You ran the script manually in production.  
Just once.

It cleared a volume.  
Restarted the app.  
Overwrote a config from staging.

Now prod and staging are entangled.  
And no one can tell them apart.

The Console King gave an order.  
The kingdom received an enigma.
