# 🌏 Level 4 — The Bash of Eternal Regret

The Console King enters `/scripts/deploy`.  
A folder sealed since the Time of the Rewrite.

Inside lies a single file: `final-final-really-final.sh`  
It’s 1,382 lines long. No comments. All inline. All powerful.

Every deploy runs it.  
No one knows what it does.  
It uses both `#!/bin/sh` and `#!/bin/bash`… somehow.  
The kingdom fears to touch it. For the last one who did… left tech.

Now, an urgent change is needed. A new region must be deployed.

The Demon of Callback Hell watches from the shadows.  
One wrong edit and he’ll unleash the Forkstorm.
