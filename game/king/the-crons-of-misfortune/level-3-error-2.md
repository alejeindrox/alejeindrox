# ‚ùå Error: Rename and Regret

You renamed the file to `.cron.bak`.  
Rebooted the server. Declared victory.

But the startup script looked for `*.cron*`.  
It found your renamed file. It ran it twice.  
The DB groaned. The alerting system summoned 14,000 enchanted ravens to warn a sysadmin long forgotten.

The Console King rules the terminal.  
But he cannot escape regex.
