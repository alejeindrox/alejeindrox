# 🌏 Level 3 — The Crons of Misfortune

The Console King awakens to a war in the background.  
Crons run. The Torch of Debugging burns uncontrolled. Alerts scream. No one knows why.

You find a cronjob last updated by a long-gone dev:  

`*/5 * * * * curl http://internal-api.local/cleanup`

But the API was deprecated. Two years ago.  
And it now triggers a full DB scan. Every 5 minutes.  
In production.

The **Demon of Callback Hell** rides upon the wings of silent automation.  
Your kingdom lags. Your engineers flee to frontend.

It’s time to restore control.
