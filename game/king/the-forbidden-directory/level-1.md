# 🌏 Level 1 — The Forbidden Directory

The crown is heavy. The throne cold.  
Before you stands a directory none dare touch:  
`/var/legacy-backups`.

It's filled with ancient `.tar.gz` scrolls, symbolic links to nothing, and a `node_modules` folder last modified in **20XX**.

Developers whisper rumors of its curse.  
The CI pipeline skips it. Git ignores it.  
But the Console King does not ask — **he commands.**
