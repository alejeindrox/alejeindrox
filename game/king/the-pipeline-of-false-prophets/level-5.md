# 🌏 Level 5 — The Pipeline of False Prophets

The build is green.  
The tests pass.  
The deploy step says: ✅ `Success`.

And yet… nothing works.

The Console King gazes into the CI logs — 14,000 lines of compressed ambiguity.  
Each job ends with `echo "Done"` — even on failure.  
One step even has `|| true` at the end of every command.

No rollback. No alert. No trace.

The Demon of Callback Hell has taken the form of **perfect output**.
