# ❌ Error: The Sleep Delay Decree

You added `sleep 2` before the symlink command.  
It seemed to work. Once. Maybe twice. CI passed... at dawn.

But the Demon of Callback Hell detected your hesitation.  
He embedded race conditions deep within your build.  
Now the pipeline fails **randomly**.  
Your team distrusts every deploy. QA has formed a rebellion.

> You didn’t fix the bug — You taught it patience.
