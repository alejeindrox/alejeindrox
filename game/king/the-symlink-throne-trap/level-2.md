# 🌏 Level 2 — The Symlink Throne Trap

The King returns to his domain — only to find… circular chaos.  
The Jenkins job failed. Again. The `dist` folder vanished.

You trace the error to a script written by the Ancients:  
`ln -s ./dist ./public/build`  
But wait — it links back to itself. Infinitely.

The logs are useless. The Torch of Debugging glows dim.  
Your pipeline is now a recursion ritual with no base case.

The Console King must act.  
And when the King decrees, the filesystem *obeys*.
