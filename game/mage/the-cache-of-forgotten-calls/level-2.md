# 🌍 Level 2 — The Cache of Forgotten Calls

You've entered a dimly-lit serverless temple.  
Stateless functions float in silence, invoking themselves… endlessly.  
Suddenly, your dashboard glows red — the external API is timing out.

Your services now rely on this call.  
The pipeline shakes with every retry.  
The Demon of Callback Hell stirs — he feeds on latency and poor fault tolerance.

You must find a way to contain the madness.
