# 🌍 Level 5 — The Calamity of Leaked Secrets

The pipeline stutters. The cloud trembles.

You discover credentials in the commit history.  
Environment variables were leaked in the frontend build.  
An `.env.production` file sits quietly in the repo… tracked. Pushed. Public.

The **Demon of Callback Hell** thrives here.  
He now knows your secrets — literally.

One wrong move, and the realm falls under credential theft and irreversible shame.
