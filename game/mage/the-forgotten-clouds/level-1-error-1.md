# ❌ Error: The Probe Gambit

You silenced the probe.  
The system thinks everything is healthy… but it's an illusion.

The Demon of Callback Hell senses the disturbance.  
He loops endlessly through health checks, mocking your fake stability.  
Suddenly, alerts erupt. A traffic surge hits, and your pods vanish like vapor.

The pipeline cracks. The fog thickens.
