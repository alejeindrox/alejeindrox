# 🌍 Level 1 — The Forgotten Clouds

You awaken inside a decaying Kubernetes pod.  
Fog swirls around legacy YAML files and deprecated APIs whisper secrets in the dark.  
A load balancer pulses weakly in the distance… something is wrong.

Suddenly, a **wild autoscaling storm** erupts.  
Traffic spikes. Logs overflow. Latency climbs like a cursed dragon.

You must act quickly.
