# 🌍 Level 4 — The Load of Infinite Shadows

You're deep within a sprawling VPC labyrinth.  
Requests are slow. Metrics flicker. And no one knows why.

You trace traffic through ALBs, NATs, lambdas, firewalls, back to…  
an undocumented service running behind a mysterious gateway.

The Demon of Callback Hell thrives here.  
He loops traffic like a Möbius function, feeding chaos to the pipeline.

You must reveal the shadow architecture before it consumes you.
