# 🌍 Level 3 — The Vault of Silent Costs

You've entered a forgotten billing dashboard.  
It creaks with untagged resources, idle Lambdas, and orphaned EBS volumes.  
A haunted spreadsheet floats above, whispering totals in languages long dead.

Suddenly — an alert!  
**$14,398.02i** charged… this week.  
But nothing changed in production.

The Demon of Callback Hell doesn't just crash apps.  
He bleeds budgets — and laughs from the shadows.

You must bring balance to this economic anomaly.
