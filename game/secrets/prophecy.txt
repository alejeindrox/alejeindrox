┃  In an age before the first branch was made, ┃
┃  and before the Eternal Pipeline flowed...   ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃  The Hacker God whispered into the console:  ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃    “Three shall rise.                        ┃
┃     From shell, from syntax, from sky.       ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃     Each shall face their Trials of Tech,    ┃
┃     And descend into the Callback Inferno.”  ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃  Yet only one will see beyond the Forkstorm. ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃  Only one will refactor destiny.             ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃  Seek the logs written not by devs...        ┃
┃  But by fate.                                ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃     🔍 Path lies between the artifacts.      ┃
┃     🔮 Truth hidden in broken status codes.  ┃
┃     🧠 Victory belongs to the curious.       ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃  And when twilight falls on a Friday,        ┃
┃  Only then will the seal break.              ┃
┃                                              ┃
┃            — The First Commit                ┃
