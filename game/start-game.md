# 🏰 Welcome, Developer...

You awaken in the dark ruins of an ancient codebase.

Lint warnings echo through the corridors.  
Forkstorms stretch across the sky like thunderclouds.
Somewhere, deep in the Eternal Pipeline, a shadow stirs...

They call it **The Demon of Callback Hell** —  
a bug so persistent, it crashes staging and mocks production.  
No log survives it. No retry saves it.  
It is race conditions and memory leaks incarnate.  

The Open Source Council is gone.  
Legacy teams have fled.  
You are the last dev brave (or foolish) enough to fight.

But you are not merely an Apprentice of Commits pushing changes into the void. 
You are no apprentice. You are a warrior. A master of your stack.
You are...

### 👑 A king of the terminal.  
### ⚔️ A refactorer of chaos.  
### 🔮 A cloud-wielding spellcaster.

Choose your class. Pick your path.  
Defeat the Demon.  
And push to `main`.
