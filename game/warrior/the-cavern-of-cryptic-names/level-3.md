# ðŸŒŽ Level 3: The Cavern of Cryptic Names

You descend into a shadowy cave where the only source of light is... badly named variables.

You're holding a file named `utils2.js`, which contains functions like `doThing()`, `handleStuff()`, and `processData(data)` â€” twice.

As you stare into the void, a comment appears:

> `// TODO: improve this if needed, maybe`

Your keyboard trembles.  
Somewhere in the distance, a rubber duck screams.
