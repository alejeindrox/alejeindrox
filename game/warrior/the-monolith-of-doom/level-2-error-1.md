# ❌ Error: The Silence of the Lords of Deadlines

You commented out the entire controller and sent a raven to the Lord of Deadlines:
_"Can you clarify what this spell is supposed to do?"_

The Lord of Deadlines has vanished into the Shadows of PTO.
The Council of Tech Leads responds: “That was written by the Elders.”
The code continues to rot.

The Demon of Callback Hell gains strength from indecision and abandonment.
