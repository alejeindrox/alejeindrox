# ‚ùå Error: Panic! At the Endpoint

You added a new route: `/panic`.  
It returns a 500 and ignites the Torch of Debugging with the phrase: "We tried."

The Torch of Debugging shines with comedy.
The bug is still there.  
And now Sentry is tagging you by name.

The Demon of Callback Hell laughs in camelCase.
