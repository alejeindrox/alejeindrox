# ðŸŒŽ Level 2: The Monolith of Doom

Youâ€™ve reached the dreaded backend monolith.

Routes, business logic, and database queries â€” all living together in one massive controller file.  
Over 2000 lines of chaos.  
The scroll wheel on your mouse starts to sweat.

Suddenly, the Torch of Debugging screams and flickers out.
You realizeâ€¦ someone put SQL queries directly inside route handlers.  
And even worse â€” one handler returns JSON, the next returns HTML, and one just crashes silently.
