# 🌎 Level 5: The Mountain of Micro-optimizations

At the summit of the architecture, you face a dilemma.

A controller is **too slow**.  
You dig in and discover the real problem:  
- Business logic tangled inside route handlers  
- Blocking synchronous calls to external APIs  
- A loop inside a loop inside a `.map()`

The Lord of Deadlines appears and whispers:  
> “Can you make it faster… by deployment eve?”

You know what needs to be done.  
But the Code Oracle weeps, and the Scrolls of Assertion tremble.
