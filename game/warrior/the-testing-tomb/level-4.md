# 🌎 Level 4: The Testing Tomb

You find yourself surrounded by crypts labeled "unit tests".  
But they don’t run. Or worse… they **pass**, but the app is still broken.

Half the tests are commented out.  
One test checks if `2 + 2 == 4`. Another one mocks `fetch()` to always return 200.

Suddenly, you step on a pressure plate and a failing test screams:  
`Expected true to be false. 🤔`
